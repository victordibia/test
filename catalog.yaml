  - title: Churn Modeling with scikit-learn
    label: churn-prediction
    short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the probability 
      that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In addition, the model is 
      interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic 
      regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability and interact with a 
      basic Flask-based web application.

  - title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
    label: image-analysis
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
      on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
      extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
      using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
      launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
      representations extracted using multiple model architectures.

  - title: Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection
    label: anomaly-detection
    short_description: Apply modern, deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify network intrusions.
    long_description: >-
      This project includes implementations of several neural networks
      (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, Bidirectional GAN, Sequence Models)
      applied to the task of anomaly detection in Tensorflow 2.0. For comparison,
      it includes two baselines (One Class SVM, PCA) and provides a frontend
      interface for exploring model results.

  - title: NeuralQA
    label: neuralqa
    short_description: >-
      Launch a visual interface for question answering that supports BERT models and information retrieval methods.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs NeuralQA
      library can be used to bootstrap an application for extractive question
      answering. The application interface integrates visualizations for
      explaining model behaviour and contextual query expansion.

  - title: Structural Time Series
    label: structural-time-series
    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.

  - title: Parametric Curve Fitting For Trend Analysis
    label: curve_fitting
    short_description: Parametric Curve Fitting For Trend Analysis.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to analyze and forecast trends on a collection of 
      time-series datasets. Using parametric curve fitting approaches. In this example, we focus on polynomial models, and additive regression models (using the prophet library).

  - title: Airline Delay Prediction
    label: airline
    short_description: Flight analytics and cancellation prediction with pyspark and sparklyr.
    long_description: >-
      This project creates an API that can predict the likelihood of a flight
      being cancelled based on historic flight data. The original dataset comes
      from Kaggle. The project shows both the pyspark and sparklyr implementations
      and covers: Importing Data Data Science and Exploration Data Engineering ML
      Model Building and Optimisation ML Model Training ML Model Serving Deploying
      an Application.

  - title: Fraud Detection
    label: fraud-detection
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      In this project, a fictional credit card company uses machine learning to
      identify fraudulent transactions that should be blocked or investigated.
      Although the features in this dataset are abstract, in principle, post hoc
      analysis could also surface fraud hotspots that could be communicated as an
      alert to customers. The techniques in this use case are applicable to any
      situation in which most measurements or events are normal, but rare outliers
      require attention.

  - title: Sentiment Analysis with Sparklyr and Tensorflow
    label: sentiment-analysis
    short_description: Build R and Python models for sentiment analysis with Spark.
    long_description: >-
      This project builds two different Sentiment Analysis models. One model is
      based on text from the Simpsons TV show available on Kaggle here and uses R
      code (specifically Sparklyr) to train the model. The other model is based on
      the Sentiment 140 dataset, also available on kaggle here and uses Python
      Code (specifically Tensorflow with GPU). The end result is an application
      that will send a test sentence to either of the deployed models and show the
      predicted sentiment result.
